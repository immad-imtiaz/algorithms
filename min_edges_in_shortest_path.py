"""
In cases where there are several different shortest paths between two nodes (and edges have
varying lengths), the most convenient of these paths is often the one with fewest edges.
Accordingly, for a specific starting node s, define
best[u] = minimum number of edges in a shortest path from s to u.
Give an efficient algorithm for the following problem
Input: Graph G = (V, E), positive edge lengths `e, starting node s âˆˆ V .
Output: The values of best[u] for all vertices u âˆˆ V .
